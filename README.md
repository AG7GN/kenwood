## 710.py and 710.sh

Two scripts that provide CAT control for Kenwood TM-D710G or TM-V71A radios on a Raspberry Pi. It requires a serial/USB cable between the radio and the Pi.  An RT Systems programming cable will work, as will a Kenwood PG-5G cable or equivalent. 

- `710.sh` is a shell script that you use in the Terminal.
- `710.py` is a Python application that allows you to control the radio through a GUI that emulates the TM-D710G's screen, although it works with the TM-V71A as well.

The `710.sh` script calls `710.py` to talk to the radio. It does not start the `710.py` GUI in this case. `710.py` uses the Python serial library to communicate with the radio. 

## Most recent significant changes

### Latest Versions

- `710.py` version 1.2.6
- `710.sh` version 5.2.1

1. In the GUI, changing the frequency when in MR mode will result in that memory location being modified. See CAVEATS below. Changing the frequency in the shell script is unchanged: The script will change to VFO mode and *attempt* to QSY to the desired frequency if allowed by the current frequency band setting. Again, see CAVEATS below for an explanation.

1. Fixed a bug where moving the data mode to the other side of the radio would not update the radio display. 

1. __REV__ now works as expected. See CAVEATS below. Thanks to Chris (KC9AD) and Mick (K7MNF) for their testing and investigation of this problem on the TM-V71A.


## CAVEATS

- Kenwood does not provide a CAT command to change the frequency band on a given side of the radio. You can only change the frequency band on the radio itself. This omission causes the following behaviors:

	1. When in VFO mode, you cannot select a frequency outside the frequency band set for that side.

	2. If you modify the frequency, tone type, tone frequency, step, reverse or modulation using the GUI (`710.py`), the change will take place __*in the current mode for that side (VFO, CALL or MR)*__. If the change to one of these parameters is requested when in MR mode, __*the data for that memory location will be modified*__! A warning message will appear in the message queue window telling the user that the memory location has been modified. 
	
		Note that unlike the radio's display, the GUI display will not display the TX frequency while PTT is active.
	
	3. If you use the shell script (`710.sh`) to change the frequency, the script will first change the mode to VFO (if it's not already in that mode) and attempt to set the desired frequency. If the desired frequency is not in the currently set frequency band for that side, the frequency will not be changed. 

	The workaround for the inability to use CAT to change the frequency band is to set your commonly used frequencies in memory locations and use the scripts to put the radio in MR mode and set a certain memory channel. One easy way to program the radio's memories is to use `chirp`, which is available via the the Nexus Updater. `chirp` uses the same serial/USB cable as the `710` scripts. 
	
	Here are some tips for using `chirp`:
	
	1. Close the `710` script while running `chirp`. Only one program can access the serial port at a time.
	1. For the TM-D710G: Select __TM-D710G__ and not TM-D710G_CloneMode. Select __TM-V71__ for that radio.
	1. On the TM-D710G, all changes you make in `chirp` are immediately sent to the radio. There is no "update" or "send to radio" action to take.
	
## Install
Pick either Easy or Manual Installation.

### Easy Installation (for Nexus users)
- Make sure your Pi is connected to the Internet.
- Click __Raspberry > Hamradio > Update Pi and Ham Apps__.
- Check __710__, click __OK__.

### Manual Installation
- Make sure your Pi is connected to the Internet.
- Open a Terminal and run these commands:

		cd ~
		rm -rf kenwood/
		git clone https://github.com/AG7GN/kenwood
		sudo cp kenwood/710.sh /usr/local/bin/
		sudo cp kenwood/*.py /usr/local/bin/
		sudo cp kenwood/*.png /usr/share/pixmaps/

## Running `710.py`

- Open a terminal and run:

		710.py 
		
	By default, `710.py` will attempt to use `/dev/ttyUSB0` at 57600 baud to communicate with the radio. You can specify a different serial port or speed on the command line. Run `710.py -h` for instructions.  Running it with `-h` will display the available serial ports.
	
	For example, to use port `/dev/ttyUSB1` @ 19200 baud, run it like this:
	
		710.py -p /dev/tty/USB1 -b 19200

	The baud rate must match the radio's __PC Port Baudrate__ (menu __920__) in the 710 and the equivalent in the 71A.
	
	The GUI features tool tips, which describe the different elements on the screen as you move your mouse over them.
	
	If you want the GUI to use a smaller desktop footprint, add the `--small` argument to `710.py`.

## Make a __Hamradio__ menu selection for `710.py`

Installing these scripts does not automatically create a Hamradio menu item because it is not possible to know in advance what serial port will be used to communicate with the radio. You can make your own Hamradio menu item as described here.

In the example below, the serial port connected to the Kenwood is `/dev/ttyUSB1`. Yours may be different. Note also that this example desktop file will launch `710.py` in "small" mode so it doesn't occupy so much screen real estate.

- Using your favorite text editor, create a file called `$HOME/.local/share/applications/kenwoodtm.desktop`

- Enter this text in the file:

		[Desktop Entry]
		Name=TM-D710G Controller
		Comment=Kenwood TM-D710G/TM-V71A Controller
		Exec=sh -c "710.py -p /dev/ttyUSB1 --small >/dev/null 2>&1"
		Icon=hamradio.png
		StartupNotify=true
		Terminal=false
		Type=Application
		Categories=HamRadio
		Keywords=Ham Radio;Rig Control

- Change the `Exec=` line to add/remove/modify arguments for your particular serial port/speed. Omit the `--small` if you want to run the GUI in regular size.

- Change the `Name=` line to suit. This is the menu item name.

- Save the file and close your editor. The new menu item should appear at the bottom of your Hamradio menu.


## Running `710.sh`
- Open a terminal and run:
  
		710.sh  
	and follow the instructions.  

By default, the script will look for USB-serial cables (represented as files) in `/dev/serial/by-id`.  If any of the devices listed have filenames that contain any of these strings, then the script will automatically select and use that cable to communicate with the radio:

		USB-Serial

		RT_Systems

		usb-FTDI

If more than one cable matches, it'll use the last matching file name alphabetically.

To view the list of files that represent the USB-serial cables, open a terminal and run this command:

	ls -al /dev/serial/by-id
	

### Notes

You can optionally supply the serial port used to connect to your radio using the `-p PORT` argument.  For example:

	710.sh -p /dev/ttyUSB0 set timeout 3

Alternatively, you optionally supply a string to grep (search) for in `/dev/serial/by-id` to determine the serial port used to connect to your radio using the `-s PORTSTRING` argument.  For example:

	710.sh -s RT_Systems get info

If a port is supplied using `-p PORT`, it will take precedence over a string supplied by `-s PORTSTRING`."

If you connect more than one serial cable and the string description for those cables contain a match of any of the strings listed above you __MUST__ use either the `-p` or `-s` options to tell the cables apart apart.

In the following example, 2 USB-serial cables are attached to the Pi:

	pi@hampi-ag7gn:~ $ ls -l /dev/serial/by-id
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jan 24 09:13 usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller_D-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jan 24 10:52 usb-RT_Systems_K5G_Radio_CaÍ¢le_RT1RVT5Y-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB1

In this example, both cables will match the default search string.  So, you must specify either the `-p` or `-s` options:

Continuing with this example, to use the cable with `RT_Systems` in the name, run:

	710.sh -s RT_Systems get info
	
To use the cable with `USB-Serial` in the name:

	710.sh -s USB-serial get info
	
When you use the `-s` option, make sure you use a search string that's unique to the cable you want to use.
